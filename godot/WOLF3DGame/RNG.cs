	/// <summary>
	/// Based on TangleRNG's algrithm, which is extremely fast, has a more-than-good-enough period of 2 to the 64,
	/// and has 2 to the 63 possible "streams" of random numbers it can produce. While not all streams have been tested
	/// (that's basically impossible), all of them tested so far have passed PractRand testing to 32TB of generated data.
	/// An individual stream is not equidistributed and will produce some results more than once over the period, while
	/// other numbers will never appear in that stream (roughly 1/3 of possible ulong results won't appear). If you look
	/// across all possible streams, however, the full set of generators is equidistributed, one-dimensionally. It is
	/// encouraged to make lots of these RNGs where their results need to be independent, rather than skipping around in
	/// just one generator.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// This is a pretty good type of random number generator, in part because it can step forwards or backwards (making
	/// some shuffle-related code much better), but also because it can repeat or skip varying sets of output numbers
	/// depending on its stream. If a generator always produced a sequence of numbers that excluded about a third of the
	/// possible range, that would be bad, but since each of these generators produces a different such sequence, it
	/// is good, because it makes predicting the output much harder.
